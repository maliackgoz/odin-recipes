            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Doner meat kebabs are popular take-out foods, especially after a night at the pub. 
            This favorite is so tasty — I'm sure once you try it, you'll certainly want to make more! 
            Serve with warmed (lightly toasted) pita bread, chili sauce, and a salad of shredded cabbage, carrot, onion, and sliced cucumber. 
            Also great to add as a topping for pizzas. Great to make in advance, slice and freeze.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Combine flour, oregano, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a large bowl. Add ground lamb and knead until thoroughly mixed together, about 3 minutes.</li>

                <li>Bake in the preheated oven, turning halfway to ensure even browning, for about 1 hour and 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Wrap loaf in aluminum foil and let rest for about 10 minutes. Slice as thinly as possible to make doner kebab pieces.</li>
